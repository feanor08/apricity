        "subtitle": "We began with a single conviction: tribal women deserve work that sustains both their families and their heritage. In villages where ancient weaving songs were fading and textile waste piled high, we saw an opportunity to rewrite the tune. So we launched Apricity Life Foundation—a grassroots NGO that intercepts discarded cloth, revives ancestral crafts, and channels the profits straight into the hands of the women who create each piece. Turning what the world called waste into fair wages, school fees, and newfound confidence. Every upcycled toy, pet bed, or hand-dyed fabric we ship is more than a product; it’s proof that when tribal women lead the value chain, whole communities rise. Join us as we weave sustainable income into every thread—and empowerment into every life we touch.",
